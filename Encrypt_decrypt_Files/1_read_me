Here you have a base code to encrypt and decrypt files in a way the algorithm only displace three character position of original data.
You can use any file name (up to 50 char) and any file extension (up to 6 char, excluding the dot '.').
The best is to run the encrypt/ decrypt .exe files at same path/ folder so the new files will be right there.

You can also run the the encrypt/ decrypt .exe files at different path however please remenber to name and address them (along with their extension) correctly

Here is an example of files names generated:

 - Original file creation (to be encrypted): C:\data.txt
   - The encrypted file will be:             C:\data_encrypted.txt

 - To decrypt you need to type:              C:\data_encrypted.txt
   - And the decrypted file will be:         C:\data_decrypted.txt
