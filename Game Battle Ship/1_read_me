This is an old school Windows console basic game:
At first you need to:
  -choice your player skills (easy, medium, hard)
  -Then choice a battle field with "S" or
  -start a new game "N"
  -Finally need to shot your enemies typing the coordinates x, y (or y, x -> doesn't matter the order);

Game over after 5 shooting errors
skills are changed (easy to medium, medium to hard) each 3 cleared levels
The game finish after 10 cleared levels

- Yes, I know that a lot is needed to improve, like enemies response, etc. 
- This code is finished because the current status is ok to play, 
  therefore I need to proceed with the studies in order to complete the course!
