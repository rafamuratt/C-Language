This is an old school Windows console app.
Here you can:

- to calculate a resistor by entering the voltage and current.

/* This program runs only using a console */

/* 1) Open your preferred console */
/* 2) Go to the path where the .exe file is located (Tip: place your file at system root (like C:\), it's location is easier) */
/* 3) Write the file name and the voltage/ current to calculate the resistor */
/* NOTE: Please use the following sintaxe:  file_name voltage1 current1 voltage2 current2 voltageN currentN */

- ENJOY ;)
