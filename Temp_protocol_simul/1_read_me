Here are two old school Windows console app.
You can simulate a simple protocol creation (16 bits) for a temperature sensor

- Temp_Read: you enter 16bits data in hexadecimal, the sw returns the converted temperature in +-째C or -+ 째F along with its error status
  It also returns the protocol itself in binary data.
  Note: the sensor ID is always 'A', the remaining data can be any hex number


- Temp_Simul: you enter the temperature in +-째C or -+ 째F along with its error status, the sw returns the 16 bits protocol in hexadecimal 
  It also returns the protocol itself in binary data.
  Note: the sensor ID is always 'A'
